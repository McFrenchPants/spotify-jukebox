# Guest Jukebox — Progress Tracker

**Read this file first in any new session.** It's the source of truth for what's done, what's next, and any context needed to resume. Task scopes/acceptance criteria live in [docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md); the frozen requirements are in [docs/DESIGN_SPEC.md](docs/DESIGN_SPEC.md).

## Status: Phase 0 in progress

**Next task: P0.5 — Design system & style guide**

## Open Questions / Blockers

- **Spotify Developer app**: need a Client ID/Secret from [developer.spotify.com](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) with a redirect URI matching the backend's callback route, before P1.1 can be completed end-to-end (it can still be coded against mocks first).
- **Admin PIN value**: not yet chosen — needed before P3.1's first real run (can default to a placeholder in `.env.example`).

## Session Log

Newest entry on top. One entry per work session — what got done, what's next, anything a future session needs to know that isn't obvious from the task table.

### 2026-08-23 — P0.4 env & secrets template
- Added `backend/.env.example` (Spotify client ID/secret, redirect URI, admin PIN placeholder `change-me`, port, DB path). `backend/.gitignore` already ignored `.env`; added `/data/` too (SQLite file destination). Root `README.md` already referenced it from P0.1.
- Next: P0.5 (design system/style guide) — last Phase 0 task before Phase 1 backend/auth work can start.

### 2026-08-23 — P0.2/P0.3 backend & frontend init
- P0.2: Express/TypeScript backend skeleton (`backend/`) — `createApp()` in `src/app.ts`, entrypoint `src/index.ts`, dotenv loading, `GET /api/health` → `{status:"ok"}`, npm scripts `dev`/`build`/`start` (tsx watch / tsc / node dist). Default port 3001. Verified: build clean, dev server returns 200 on `/api/health`.
- P0.3: Vite+React+TS frontend skeleton (`frontend/`) via `npm create vite@latest`, Tailwind CSS v4 wired through `@tailwindcss/vite` (no separate `tailwind.config.js` — v4 style), placeholder page, PWA `public/manifest.json` stub linked from `index.html`. Verified: `npm run build` succeeds, dev server serves HTML + manifest.
- Note for later phases: Tailwind v4 has no `tailwind.config.js`; theme tokens for P0.5 (design system) go via CSS `@theme` directive in `src/index.css` instead of a JS config file.
- Next: P0.4 (env/secrets template), then P0.5 (design system) before Phase 4 frontend work.

### 2026-08-23 — P0.1 repo skeleton
- Added root `.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`, `README.md` (run-instructions stub) and created `backend/`/`frontend/` dirs. Committed (`46b717c`).
- Next: P0.2 (backend init) and P0.3 (frontend init) in parallel.

### 2026-08-23 — Design/UX & real-time revision
- User feedback: plan was engineering-only, missing visual design, kiosk vs. mobile layout consideration, micro-interaction/polish detail, and relied on sluggish 5s client polling.
- Clarified: no kiosk display for v1 (phones only, but tokens shouldn't preclude one later), dark album-art-driven ambient theme, SSE (not WebSockets) for live updates.
- Updated DESIGN_SPEC.md to v1.2.0: added §6a (SSE real-time sync), §9a (UI/UX design system — theme, tokens, primitives, micro-interactions), kiosk non-goal in §11, §12 revision history.
- Updated IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md: added P0.5 (design system/style guide) and P1.5 (SSE endpoint); reworked P4.1–P4.4 to build on the design system and consume SSE instead of polling; added P4.7 (micro-interactions/motion pass).
- Still no code written. Next: start Phase 0 (P0.1 repo skeleton), now including P0.5 design system before Phase 4 frontend work begins.

### 2026-08-23 — Planning session
- Read the source design doc, clarified requirements with the user (access model, trust model, hosting, audio bridge, admin auth).
- Wrote [docs/DESIGN_SPEC.md](docs/DESIGN_SPEC.md) (finalized, with a deviations table vs the original draft) and [docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) (5 phases, task IDs P0.1–P5.5).
- No code written yet. Repo not yet git-initialized.
- Next: start Phase 0 (repo/project scaffolding).
